	; a c64 assembly program to test anything with the accumulator  LDA, TAX , TAY, TXA , TYA

	processor 6502 ; use the 6502 processor
	org 	$8000 ; jump to addres 8000 , so that i doesnt run in registers

	; <--- this is an comment
	LDA #$01 	; this operation loads the value 4 in to the accumulator
	STA $8030
	LDA #$FF
	ADC $8030
	; CARRY FLAG geset

	ADC $8030
	SBC $8030
	; STA $8015 
	; LSR $8015
	; LSR
	; TAX 		;  test if the value 4 is transfered to the accumulator
	; TAY 		; test if the value 4 is transefered to the accumulator
	; LSR

	; LDA $04 this would load the value of the memory address at 04 into the accumulator 

	; PHA 		 ; push the accumulator on the stack
	; LDA #$00 	 ; clear the accumulator
	; PLA 		 ; pull the accumulator from the stack 
	; STP  stop the processor
	dc 	$db ; runs the stop code
