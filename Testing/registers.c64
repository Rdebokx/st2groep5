	; a c64 assembly program to test anything with the registers  INX, INY 

	processor 6502 ; use the 6502 processor
	org 	$8000 ; jump to addres 8000 , so that i doesnt run in registers

	; <--- this is an comment
	LDA #$04 	; this operation loads the value 4 in to the accumulator
	; LDA $04 this would load the value of the memory address at 04 into the accumulator 

	; TEST TAX , TAY
	TAX  ; test if the value 4 is transfered to the accumulator
	; TAY  ; test if the value 4 is transefered to the accumulator

	; TEST INY, INX
	; INY  ; increase the Y register with one , result  Y is 5
	; INX  ; increase the X register with one , result  X is 5

	; TEST DEX , DEY
	; DEX 	; decrease the X register with one , result : X is 3
	; DEY 	; decrease the Y register with one , result : Y is 3

	; TEST TYA, TXA
	; TYA     ; transfers the Y register to the accumulator, result : A is 3
	; TXA 	; transfers the X register to the accumulator, result : A is 4
	
	; TEST TXS , TYS
	; TXS 	; the stackpointer should be the value of 4
	; LDA #$00 ; let the accumulator be zero
	; TAX 	; transer the value of the accumulator to the X register, result is 0
	; TSX 	; transer the stack pointer to X , X should become 4

	; TEST ASL
	; ASL 	; the value of the accumulator is 4 so with an arithmethic shift left i should become 8 

	; STP  stop the processor
	dc 	$db ; runs the stop code
